## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **TypeScript Compilation Errors**
- Fixed Category enum import from Prisma client
- Defined local Category type as union: `"Meals" | "ColdBeverages" | "HotBeverages"`
- Fixed Material and Ingredient interface definitions
- Added proper type casting for form inputs

### 2. **Type Safety Improvements**
- Added explicit type annotations for array mapping functions
- Fixed property access for materials and ingredients objects
- Proper error handling with type checking

### 3. **Build Process**
- ✅ Next.js build: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ Capacitor sync: **SUCCESSFUL**
- ✅ All admin pages compile without errors

## Expected Behavior Now

When creating a product in admin:
1. **Form loads without "Application Error"** ✅
2. **Category dropdown works** ✅ 
3. **Size options populate based on category** ✅
4. **Materials and ingredients can be added** ✅
5. **Form validation works** ✅

## Root Cause Analysis

The "Application Error: a client-side exception has occurred" was caused by:

1. **Invalid Prisma imports**: The app was trying to import `Category`, `Ingredient`, `Material` from `@prisma/client` but these types were either missing or incompatible with the current schema
2. **Type mismatches**: Various form inputs had string/number type conflicts
3. **Property access errors**: Objects didn't have the expected properties due to schema differences

## Fix Summary

- Replaced Prisma type imports with local type definitions
- Added proper type casting throughout the component
- Fixed object property access patterns
- Maintained all functionality while ensuring type safety

The product creation page should now load and function without client-side exceptions.
